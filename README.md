## Description of the Program

The **Turtle Spiral Manager** is a Python program that creates multiple turtles on the screen and moves them in a spiral pattern that grows indefinitely. Each turtle zlso has a different shape and color, which adds to the quality of the output.

### Features
- **Turtle Creation**: Turtles are created with different shapes and colors which are then added to the spiral pattern
- **Spiral Movement**: The turtles follow a determined spiral path
- **Infinite Turtle Generation**: Once the initial set of turtles runs out, new turtles are added to continue the spiral

### Target Audience
- **Students**: This project is aimed at students learning about turtle graphics in Python.
- **Python Enthusiasts**: Made for anyone interested in projects using Python's `turtle` module

## How the Program Works
1. **TurtleManager Class**: 
   - Manages a collection of turtles
   - Initializes turtles with different shapes and colors
   - Moves turtles in a spiral pattern and then continuously adds more turtles
   
2. **Spiral Movement**:
   - Turtles start at the center (0, 0).
   - Each turtle moves forward at a 45-degree angle
   - With each step, the spiral slowly grows in increments

## User Story
As a student, I want to create an interesting turtle that moves in a spiral, so that I can learn more about programming and turtle graphics.
